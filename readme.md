#FEWD Week #1: Portfolio Assignment

!!! A few important updates to the assignment due at the start of class on 10/20:

1) I will primarily be looking at your Portfolio page when assessing the assignment

2) Be sure to change portfolio.html to use the word "resume" instead of "portfolio", while sticking to the [naming conventions](http://thenewcode.com/30/HTML-naming-conventions-and-file-management) outlined here.

3) I reccomend saving the sample files directly into your "homework-portfolio" repository/folder on your computer.  This will make submitting the assignment easier.  

###PREWORK INSTRUCTIONS 

Please review the following prior to beginning the assignment

1) Review the sample solution in the index.html and style.css files for the cookie assignment here:

###Description/Instructions


For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website. Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects you'll be completing over the next few weeks. 

The goal here is to build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio Page' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](images) with descriptions of the work you [will] do for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--I'm providing you with [some sample copy](sample_copy.txt) that you can use.

Like I mentioned in class, I am providing you with a sample solution for the About Me page.  It is contained in the index.html file and links to the css/style.css file.  Because of this, I am going to be focusing more on the portfolio page when providing feedback.  
  
  *  Note: I am linking to a css file in a subdirectory.  This is an example of something that is important but we did not cover in class.  Please reference the link on absolute vs relative URLs in the "Week 2" resources on the [front page of the class repo](https://github.com/ga-students/fewd-dtla-6))

 Feel free to get creative with regard to layout, color, styling, etc!  

 There is a lot of reading and resources here to review, so feel free to keep using the About Me page I am providing, and simply markup and style your own portoflio page for this assignment (HINT: try having both html files link to the same style.css file). 

 That being said, I do strongly encourage you to get creative, experiment, and style the pages to your liking!   

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: Before you begin, rename your portfolio.html file to use the word "resume" instead of "portfolio", but be sure to follow the [naming conventions](http://thenewcode.com/30/HTML-naming-conventions-and-file-management) outlined here.
